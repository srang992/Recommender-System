# Recommender-System

In this project, I tried to create a simple movie recommendation system based on implicit ratings. The dataset is taken from Kaggle. After that, I deployed it in Docker. This recommender system gives movie suggestions according to user preferences.

This repository contains all files used in making content based recommendation system. The whole details about this project is given in my two medium articles. The links are given below.
